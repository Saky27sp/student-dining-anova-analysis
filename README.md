# student-dining-anova-analysis
Let’s consider a scenario where we can find valuable insights into the spending habits and lifestyles of college-going students staying in hostels by simply understanding the meal choices they tend to make. We are planning to study this via a project named, ‘Student Meal Choices: How Often They Eat Out and How Much They Are Willing to Pay’, which will primarily aim to study and analyze the trends followed by the tendencies of students in BITS Pilani. We will start targeting the frequency students tend to decide to have their meals outside their conventional messes along with the extra price they are willing to pay for each meal.
Currently, we have identified a few dependent and independent variables which we will be using to proceed with the analysis. The dependent variables include number of days in a week when a student chose to have his meal outside the hostel in any outlet. Also, approximately the price of meal he/she can prefer to spend on a meal.
The above-stated factors will not only help us understand the frequency of them eating outside but also the financial impact this tendency of eating outside will have.
Coming to the independent variables we have:
1.	The student is enrolled in which academic program, i.e., either UG (undergraduate) or HD, PhD (Post-Grad).
2.	The preference of going for vegetarian or non-vegetarian food.
3.	Any particular habits or routines which they follow to maintain and keep track of their health. 
These independent variables will help us understand how factors like the background from which a student is coming, his/her food preferences, and any health habits that may influence the behavior in which they have their meals outside.
To assure the consistency of this experiment and project, we are keeping the ‘quality of the mess food’ as our control variable throughout thereby using this particular control variable, we can simply focus on other factors that will affect and make the students decide to eat outside the hostel mess accordingly.
Our action plan is to collect and store data via Google Forms along with offline, in-person surveys. We will target a sample size of about 240 students. The responses will thereby provide us with sufficient dataset to conclude meaningful conclusions.
